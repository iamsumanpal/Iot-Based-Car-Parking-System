# Iot-Based-Car-Parking-System
# Problem statement:
1.Car drivers face problems looking for car parks
2.Time and fuel wasted in waiting in queues
3.Causes traffic congestions
4.Extra fume exhaust is also not eco-friendly

# Proposed Solution:
1.IOT Car Park System allows users to use their mobile phones to check if car park is available for a specific building and to know exactly where
2.Allows users to go directly to the correct floor and exact parking lot 
3.Users can also check for alternative car parks with empty parking lots
